Raspberry pi or its latest version pi 2 mod B is a (I would not say cheap) low cost, credit card sized computer. Pi&nbsp;can plug into your computer monitor or TV set and uses a standard keyboard and mouse (wired or Wireless). It is capable of delivering everything that is expected from a desktop computer, from programming, gaming, internet browsing, playing HD videos and a lot more.

The more powerful stuff is you can write programs in PYTHON to use Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and control hardware or read from sensors. For beginners and children SCRATCH game maker is bundled. From experienced hobbyists to hackers and even school children, everyone is making an excellent use of &nbsp;Raspberry pi.

The cost of Raspberry pi mod A is $25 and Raspberry pi 2 mod B is $35. The reason for low cost is Soc (system on chip), a computer on a single low voltage chip and open source OS like LINUX, Snappy Ubuntu Core and Microsoft Windows10 .

Detailed comparison of Raspberry Pi mod A+ and Pi 2 model B is provided in this [Getting Started](http://www.techsquids.com/iot/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-2-mod-b/ "Getting Started with Raspberry Pi 2 mod B") guide

Raspberry Pi 2 mod B has –
