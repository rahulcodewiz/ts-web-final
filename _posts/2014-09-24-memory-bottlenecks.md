 **The basic symptoms of memory bottlenecks that affect application performance are -**

1. **Memory leak**

- Memory usage slowly increases over time
- Performance degrades
- Application will freeze/crash requiring a restart
- After restart application is running fine again, and the behavior continues

1. **Excessive memory footprint**

- Application is slow to load
- After load, other application runs slower than expected

1. **&nbsp;Inefficient allocation**

- Application performance suddenly degrades and then recovers quickly
- % Time in GC Statistic in PerfMon is greater than 20â€“30%
